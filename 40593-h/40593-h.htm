<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p class="indent">The original Edition of <i>School-Room Humour</i>
published two years ago gave so much pleasure to so many people that it
has occurred to me that a new and enlarged edition may prove not
entirely unacceptable. I have therefore added the best from my
collection since the first publication; and now, as then, tender my
thanks to the proprietors of the <i>Schoolmaster</i> and to my friends
the elementary school teachers.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>School-Room Humour</i> having proved a constant
source of enjoyment to an ever-widening public, the Publishers have
pleasure in issuing a third edition, revised, and with a picture cover,
and trust that in its new dress the little book will continue to provide
amusement for a large circle of readers.</p>

<h1>School-Room Humour.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>A LITTLE GENERAL DISQUISITION.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">TEACHER</span>: &quot;<i>What does B.C. stand for?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">SCHOLAR</span>: &quot;<i>Before Christ!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">TEACHER</span>: &quot;<i>Good! Now what does B.A. stand for?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">SCHOLAR</span>: &quot;<i>Before Adam!</i>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It is not to be denied that the life of the
schoolmaster is always exacting, usually tedious, and occasionally
irritating. It is not to be denied that long-enduring patience, untiring
perseverance, and philosophical resignation are only the first three of
the many qualities essential to success. But still the drudgery of
teaching has its compensations. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
they are the more acceptable because of their rare charm. There, in the
schoolmaster&#39;s keeping, is the youthful mind. What may he not do
with it? What forgetfulness of the dreary round of toil the very
contemplation of the situation compels! And when his task is achieved,
and the finished product of his labour has passed out into the world,
with what quiet and ineffable satisfaction the schoolmaster reflects
upon the part he played in the making of men. In the days of my
schoolmastering I fell into this mood always&mdash;gently carried thence
by some beneficent ministering angel&mdash;when wearied and worried at
the close of the long day&#39;s toil; and in that mood was more balm
than in many sedatives and more sereneness than in much repose. This is
the schoolmaster&#39;s first great compensation.</p>

<p class="indent">But there is that other. There is the agreeable
amazement that the working of the fresh child-mind is always provoking.
And in this the schoolmaster is regularly furnished with food for
pleasant reflection and for engaging conjecture day by day throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
the whole of his pedagogic career. &quot;Child-study&quot; and
&quot;Psychology&quot; have in recent times taken severely scientific
shape, and have fallen under the ægis of Government Departments and into
Government Syllabuses. Good! But the least observant and the least
interested of all the schoolmasters of the land, long before the Board
of Education ever added &quot;Child-study&quot; to its quaint if not
exactly terrifying terminology, have never failed to arrive empirically
at certain broad conclusions with regard to the child-mind which have
been reached by practical and altogether delightful daily experiences.
Heaven forbid that I should unduly weary the reader with disquisitions
on these conclusions. But, at any rate, I may acceptably rehearse some
of the experiences.</p>

<p class="indent">Now I admit at once that very many of the artlessly
amusing things which are alleged to have been uttered by that prime
unconscious humorist, the schoolboy, are quite apocryphal. They have
been ingeniously excogitated by their unabashed and artful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
elders for the purpose of creating a laugh. They used to say that quill
pens survived in the office of the Board of Education in order that the
Inspectors and other officials, in the operation of persistently
trimming them, might never be without something to do. That is absurd.
There is always the profitable preoccupation of manufacturing funny
puerile answers to inspectorial hypothetical questions. Why not? The
proceeding is innocent enough. But it <i>does</i> tend to make one
incredulous. For example, I was once told that a London Board School
child defined &quot;<i>a lie</i>&quot; as &quot;<i>an abomination in the
sight of the Lord, but a very present help in time of trouble</i>.&quot;
It is possible, remotely possible. But it is extremely unlikely. Then
when I am told that a youngster described &quot;<i>the liver</i>&quot;
as &quot;<i>an infernal organ</i>,&quot; I see visions of a not
fully-occupied civil servant suffering acutely from an attack of chronic
indigestion which has put him badly off his drive. So, too, when I am
told that a Bristol youngster once wrote, &quot;<i>The bowels are five
in number, namely a, e, i, o and u</i>,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
like the Scotsman, &quot;I hae ma doots!&quot; Then there is the classic
answer to the question: &quot;What proof have we from the Bible that it
is not lawful to have more than one wife&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>Because it
says no man can serve two masters!</i>&quot; No child ever said
<i>that</i>. And belonging to the same category is the following. The
teacher asked: &quot;If one man walking at the rate of three miles an
hour gets half an hour&#39;s start of another man walking at the rate of
four miles an hour, when will the second man overtake the first?&quot;
The allegation is that the small boy replied: &quot;<i>Please, sir, at
the first public-house!</i>&quot; But I know that small boy. He is a
wag, it is true; but he doesn&#39;t wear knickerbockers.</p>

<p class="indent">So far as possible, therefore, I will endeavour to
reject the apocryphal in favour of the authentic, giving the former the
benefit of the doubt, of course, if on its merits the humour of the
anecdote seems to condone the illegitimacy of its origin.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>CHILDREN&#39;S WITTICISMS CRITICALLY
CONSIDERED.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<i>A focus is a thing that looks like a
mushroom, but if you eat it you will feel different to a
mushroom.</i>&quot;&mdash;<span class="smcap">SMALL GIRL.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Of course children&#39;s witticisms are always
unconscious. They have taken the idiomatic quite literally: not quite
caught our meaning; missed the right word in favour of another that is
curiously like it in sound.</p>

<p class="indent">Reasonably enough the idiom is extremely troublesome
to the child-mind. &quot;The doctor says my mother has one foot in the
grave,&quot; wrote a little girl the other day in a Composition
Exercise. &quot;That is not true. <i>She has both feet in bed!</i>&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Again, if people <i>will</i> talk about &quot;going it
bald-headed,&quot; or about being &quot;stony-hearted&quot; or
&quot;iron-fisted&quot; or &quot;brazen-faced,&quot; and so on, they
must naturally expect young children to accept the phraseology in its
literal sense. Hence amusing misconceptions.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, as I say, it is often a question of not having
quite got the right word. Having mumbled The Lord&#39;s Prayer every day
for a year or so, we ultimately get the young Cockney who is found to be
rendering &quot;Lead us not into temptation&quot; as &quot;<i>Lead us
not into Thames Station</i>&quot;&mdash;a London police court shunned of
all good costers and others. So too, taught that the Epiphany is a
Manifestation, we condone readily the mistake of the little girl who, to
her teacher&#39;s complete and abiding mystification, insisted that the
Epiphany was &quot;<i>the-man-at-the-station!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Owing its origin to the same sort of misconception is
the genuinely funny answer of the boy who wrote, &quot;The marriage
customs of the ancient Greeks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
that a man had only one wife, and this was called
<i>Monotony</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, again, the child-mind is absolutely fresh and
alert. It is to the adult mind as is the plastic clay to the baked
brick. It is not already overlaid with impressions; it is not restricted
in its elasticity by the petrifying effects of already-received
preconceptions; it is refreshingly new and instantly impressionable. It
is because of this that a youngster wrote: &quot;<i>A vacuum is nothing
shut up in a box.</i>&quot; It is because of this, too, that the little
girl said: &quot;The zebra is like a horse, only striped <i>and used to
illustrate the letter Z</i>.&quot; Owing its origin to the same
freshness of view, we get the following: Two children being awakened one
morning and being told that they had a new little brother, were keen, as
children are, to know whence and how he had come. &quot;It must have
been the milkman,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Why the milkman?&quot;
asked her little brother. &quot;<i>Because it says on his cart</i>,
&#39;<i>Families supplied</i>,&#39;&quot; replied the sister. Not less
quaintly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
ingenuous and fresh is the reply of a little chap in a Nature-study
lesson. &quot;Think,&quot; said the teacher, &quot;of a little creature
that wriggles about in the earth and sometimes comes to the top through
a tiny hole.&quot; A small boy in a pinafore put up his hand joyously.
&quot;Well?&quot; queried the teacher. &quot;A worm,&quot; said the
small boy. &quot;Yes,&quot; said the teacher, &quot;now think of another
little creature that wriggles about in the earth and comes to the top
through a small hole.&quot; Up went the joyous hand again.
&quot;Well?&quot; asked the teacher. &quot;<i>Another worm!</i>&quot;
shouted Tommy in triumph.</p>

<p class="indent">The workings of the child-mind, the quaint, homely
wisdom and shrewdness that it not infrequently displays, and the pathos
that&mdash;so far as the working-class children are concerned&mdash;it
so often discovers, are engrossingly interesting. Take the case of the
reply to the Inspector who, putting a &quot;Mental Arithmetic&quot;
question, asked: &quot;If I had three glasses of beer on this table and
your father came in and drank one, how many would be left?&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
&quot;None, sir,&quot; at once replied a very small urchin. &quot;But
you don&#39;t understand my question,&quot; retorted the inspector,
proceeding to repeat it. This he did several times, always receiving the
same unwavering assurance, &quot;None, sir!&quot; At last he said:
&quot;Ah, my boy, it is clear you don&#39;t know mental
arithmetic.&quot; &quot;<i>But I know my father</i>,&quot; answered the
boy.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, there is the instance of the little chap driven
into desperation and escaping by a wild stretch of the imagination.
&quot;Who made the world?&quot; snapped out a rather testy inspector
years ago to a class of very small boys. No answer. Several times he
repeated the question, getting louder and more angry each time. At last
a poor little fellow, kneading his eyes vigorously with his knuckles,
blubbered out: &quot;<i>Please, sir, it was me. But I won&#39;t do it
any more!</i>&quot; Which recalls to me the old Scotch chestnut:
&quot;Why did the priest and the Levite pass by on the other side,
child?&quot; &quot;<i>Because the puir man had been robbed
already!</i>&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Much of the school-room humour purveyed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
the delectation of us elders by the unconscious wits of the schoolroom
is provoked by quaint pieces of &quot;Composition.&quot; Of these I give
later a number. One of the most amusing is that by a young lady in the
Sixth Standard, who very frankly and faithfully expresses her views on
&quot;Schoolmasters.&quot; She writes so candidly, that I produce her
essay here as a wholesome corrective to professional vanity and as an
acute witness to the necessity to &quot;see ourselves as others see
us&quot;:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Schoolmasters are a class of people who have a
tendency to a bad temper, and who are generally armed with a cane. We
have a very good sample at our school, for we have a schoolmaster who
is, as a rule, &#39;better in health than temper,&#39; especially when
we have Geography. To hear most schoolmasters talk you would think that
they never did wrong in their lives; and, of course, they will tell you
that when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
went to school they never used to talk, and they never got the stick;
but whether they used to talk in school or not I do not know. All I can
say is, that they can talk like magpies when they are outside. Well, I
suppose we must have schoolmasters, or we should all be very ignorant
indeed&mdash;&mdash;.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Much fun is got out of the weird and fearfully
contrived &quot;Notes&quot; which teachers receive from the poorer
working-class parents. I have not dwelt much on these, as I never see
one of these &quot;Notes&quot; without feeling more inclined to cry than
to laugh. If the State had known and had done its duty earlier there
would be less melancholy fun in these self-same parental
&quot;Notes.&quot; I will only dare to
reproduce two here:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Pleas Sur, Jonnie was kep home to day. I have
had twins. <i>It shant ocur again.</i> Yours truely Mrs. Smith.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
The other is given in the stories which follow; but it is worth
repeating:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Plese excuse mary being late as she <i>as been
out on a herring</i>!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It is the fact, and it is not altogether to be
wondered at, that the Scripture lesson is a prime source of juvenile
undoing. The proper names used are so hard and unfamiliar, and the scope
of the subject is so often so far beyond the children&#39;s capacity,
that the wonder is that the misconceptions and errors are so few. Then,
again, the children mostly learn their Scripture texts and so on <i>viva
voce</i> from the teacher. Many repetitions cause them to distort the
words; and then when they come to write them down the result is, not to
put too fine a point upon it, as Mr. Snagsby would say, startling. The
classical instance is that given in the report of the
&quot;Newcastle&quot; Commission on the Condition of Elementary
Education in 1855. The questions were: &quot;What is thy duty towards
God?&quot; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
&quot;What is thy duty towards thy neighbour?&quot; Here are the two
answers given by the Commissioners:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;My duty toads God is to bleed in Him, to fering
and to loaf withold your arts, withold my mine, withold my sold, and
with my sernth, to whirchp and give thanks, to put my old trash in Him,
to call upon Him, to onner His old name and His world, and to save Him
truly all the days of my life&#39;s end.&quot; &quot;My dooty toads my
nabers, to love him as thyself, and to do to all men as I wed thou shall
and to me; to love onner, and suke my farther and mother; to onner and
to bay the Queen and all that are pet in a forty under her; to smit
myself to all my gooness, teaches, sportial pastures, and marsters,
&amp;c., &amp;c.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">One of the funniest of mistakes made by the daily
verbal reiteration of phrases neither understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
nor seen in black and white is the story of the boy who came back from a
visit to an aquarium and was very disappointed that they had not shown
him &quot;<i>the timinies</i>.&quot; After some cross-examination the
mystery was cleared up. It will be fully appreciated if I recite the
fact that &quot;in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
<i>and all that in them is</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What I may, for lack of a better definition, describe
as an oblique method of applying what those very learned and very dull
people the Psychologists call &quot;the Principle of Association of
Ideas&quot; is another fruitful source of laughable errors. For
instance, teach a child that &quot;<i>tigress</i>&quot; is the feminine
of &quot;<i>tiger</i>&quot;; now proceed to tell it that <i>&quot;a
fort&quot; is a place in which soldiers live</i>; the odds are that if
you ask it at once what &quot;<i>a fortress</i>&quot; is it will say
that it <i>is a place for soldiers&#39; wives to live in</i>! So it will
tell you that &quot;<i>Shero</i>&quot; is the feminine of
&quot;<i>Hero</i>,&quot; and &quot;<i>Madam</i>&quot; of
&quot;<i>Adam</i>&quot;! You may also get &quot;<i>Buttress</i>&quot; as
&quot;<i>the wife of a Butler</i>.&quot; Certainly I have seen
&quot;<i>Pedigree</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
<i>is a Schoolmaster</i>,&quot; and &quot;<i>Filigree is a list of your
descendants!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tell a youngster that &quot;<i>an optician</i>&quot;
is a person who looks after your eyes and then ask what &quot;<i>a
pessimist</i>&quot; is, the odds are some little gamin will reply,
&quot;<i>A person who looks after your feet</i>,&quot; or &quot;<i>your
hands</i>,&quot; or &quot;<i>your ears</i>,&quot; or &quot;<i>your
legs</i>,&quot; as the fancy strikes him. Describe &quot;<i>an
Apostle</i>&quot; and then say, &quot;<i>Now what&#39;s an
Epistle?</i>&quot; and you may get, &quot;<i>The wife of an
Apostle.</i>&quot; You may also get &quot;<i>Primate</i>&quot; as the
wife of &quot;<i>a Prime Minister</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is very curious to note how children are attracted
by Mr. Chamberlain. He and King Edward are the two public men whose
names appear most often in their &quot;Pieces of Composition.&quot; Such
men as the Prime Minister, the Duke of Devonshire, and even Lord
Rosebery&mdash;always popular figures with adults&mdash;have no
attractions for the youngsters. Indeed, Mr. Chamberlain provokes one of
the funniest things in the whole of the anecdotes which I have ventured
to relate. &quot;<i>He is a man</i>,&quot; writes a young hopeful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;<i>who broke out among other people</i>!&quot; Isn&#39;t that just
delicious? I am half inclined to think that the distinguished
Parliamentarian who just now leads the House of Commons would utter a
fervent &quot;Hear! hear!&quot; were that simple and yet striking answer
rehearsed to him.</p>

<p class="indent">What quiet humour, too, there is in that rare
definition of &quot;<i>Etc.</i>&quot;: &quot;<i>It is a sign used to
make believe you know more than you do!</i>&quot; Take, again, the
reason given for David&#39;s preference. Why would he rather be a
doorkeeper in the house of the Lord? &quot;<i>Because he could walk
about outside while the sermon was being preached!</i>&quot; Could
anything be more convincing? Or take, again, that rare new axiom that
outeuchres Euclid: &quot;<i>When you are in the middle you are half
over!</i>&quot; Did ever the self-evident truth stand more completely
foursquare and without need of proof?</p>

<p class="indent">Still again, take the reason given for putting a
hyphen between <i>bird</i> and <i>cage</i>: &quot;<i>For the bird to
perch on!</i>&quot; Not less conclusive is the little one&#39;s reply in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
the lesson on &quot;The elephant and his trunk.&quot; &quot;Now my
dear,&quot; says the amiable and hopeful infants&#39; mistress,
&quot;you shall tell me what <i>your</i> nose is for.&quot; &quot;<i>Us
haves it to wipe, miss!</i>&quot; Which recalls the rough, commonsense
reproof which a Roman Catholic priest once gave a distinguished
inspector who was examining a class of ragged little Standard II. gamins
in a poor town school in the western country: &quot;<i>What</i>,
boys,&quot; he asked, &quot;<i>is the function of a verb</i>?&quot;
Blank silence reigned until the priest stepped up to the inspector and
said <i>sotto voce</i>: &quot;<i>You are an old ass&mdash;&mdash;!
It&#39;s as much as we can do here to get these youngsters to stand
upright and keep their noses clean!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But let me without further running&mdash;and more or
less impertinent&mdash;comment try to classify my budget of anecdotes
and let them speak for themselves. I will only add to this critical
comment the fact that the stories which follow have been collected
assiduously and stored up jealously during the thirty years I have been
connected with schoolmastering either as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Board School teacher, a London School Board member, or as editor of the
organ of the National Union of Teachers, <i>The Schoolmaster</i>, in the
columns of which journal most of them have from time to time
appeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>A BUDGET OF QUAINT DEFINITIONS.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">TEACHER</span>: &quot;<i>Name the head of the English Church.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">ALFRED THE SMALL</span>: &quot;<i>The Archipelago of Canterbury!</i>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent">I shall endeavour, as far as possible, to classify my
collection of stories. And in pursuance of this purpose I cannot,
perhaps, do better than start out with some quaint definitions.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">With a Ring of
Triumph.</span>&mdash;A class of infants was being taught a recitation
in which the word &quot;battledore&quot; occurred. The teacher asked if
any child knew the meaning. Only one child raised his hand, and, with a
ring of triumph in his voice, gave the answer: &quot;<i>A door what a
soldier comes out of.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
<span class="smcap">&quot;What they Call a
Watershed.&quot;</span>&mdash;Asked to write a definition of &quot;A
Watershed&quot; one potential Christopher Columbus wrote: &quot;A
watershed is a thing that when the soil in part of a river stands
straight up on one side and slants tremendously the other side, the
water is obliged to go up the soil on one side and come slanting down
the other side&mdash;that is what they call a watershed.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A New View of the
Constitution.</span>&mdash;&quot;A Limited Monarchy,&quot; wrote a small
boy, &quot;is a government by a monarchy, who in case of bankruptcy
would not be responsible for the entire national debt. In private life
you have the same thing with a Limited Liability Company.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Concerning the
Heretic.</span>&mdash;&quot;A Heretic,&quot; wrote a practical young
person, &quot;is one who never would believe what he was told, but only
after seeing it and hearing it himself with his own eyes.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span> <span class="smcap">Not so Far
Out.</span>&mdash;&quot;The Court of Chancery,&quot; wrote another,
&quot;is called this because they take care of property there on the
chance of an owner turning up.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Short Title and
Description.</span>&mdash;&quot;The Five Mile Act was passed,&quot;
according to one youthful historian, &quot;by Queen Victoria to prevent
loafing and drunkenness in public-houses. People must prove that they
had travelled five miles before they would be supplied with beer and
spirits. This made people ashamed to get so drunk as before.&quot; The
youthful essayist is clearly muddling &quot;the <i>bona fide</i>
traveller&quot; clause with the provisions of a much more ancient
statute.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Rough on the
Barber.</span>&mdash;Teacher (after class had read of St. Paul&#39;s
adventures among the &quot;barbarians of Melita&quot;): &quot;What is a
Barbarian?&quot; Pupil: &quot;<i>A man who cuts hair, sir!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
<span class="smcap">A New Axiom.</span>&mdash;In the Euclid lesson the
teacher asked, after explaining the meaning of An Axiom, if a boy could
give one of his own. A lad replied: &quot;<i>When you are in the middle
you are half-way over.</i>&quot; And who shall say him nay?</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A
Mediator.</span>&mdash;&quot;Well, John,&quot; asked the master,
&quot;what is a Mediator?&quot; John&#39;s face beamed knowingly:
&quot;<i>A fellow who says hit me instead!</i>&quot; he promptly
retorted.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">B.A.!&mdash;During a reading lesson, taken from
Standard III. Historical Reader, the pupil teacher asked what the
letters &quot;B.C.&quot; represented. On receiving the answer
&quot;Before Christ,&quot; she ventured to improve the opportunity by
asking for the meaning of other abbreviations, amongst which was B.A. A
little girl at once said: &quot;<i>Before Adam!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
<span class="smcap">Etc.!</span>&mdash;&quot;What do we imply when we
use this abbreviation?&quot; asked the teacher. &quot;<i>It is a
sign</i>,&quot; said a young one very sententiously, &quot;<i>which is
used to make believe you know more than you really do!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Painted on the
Water-carts.</span>&quot;&mdash;&quot;What is a Martyr?&quot; asked the
inspector. &quot;<i>A water-cart.</i>&quot; &quot;A water-cart?&quot;
&quot;<i>Yes, sir.</i>&quot; The inspector was puzzled; but after long
cogitation he recalled the fact that he was in the parish of St. George
the Martyr. This parish does its own contracting, and the boy has seen
&quot;<i>St. George the Martyr</i>&quot; <i>painted on the
water-carts</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">What is a Zebra?</span>&mdash;A
class of Standard II. in a small town in Westmoreland was once
questioned about the zebra. There seemed to be a great lack of knowledge
about it, and the young teacher strove with heroic patience to draw some
answer from his pupils. Great was the delight of both teacher and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
class on receiving the following apt definition from one of their
number: &quot;<i>Please, sir, it&#39;s like a donkey with a Kendal
Hornet&#39;s jersey on.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;<span
class="smcap">Jography.</span>&quot;&mdash;&quot;Well, little boys, and
what <i>is</i> Geography?&quot; beamed the inspector, after getting
correctly some names of rivers, mountains, &amp;c. No answer for two
minutes by the clock. Then one timid hand is raised in answer to the
question: &quot;<i>Please, sir, jography is a ball on which we
live!</i>&quot; This recalls the story of the boy who was asked for a
proof that the world is round. His answer was: &quot;<i>It says in the
Bible, World without end!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">True Both Ways.</span>&mdash;Some
years ago, writes a teacher, I used to take Standard I. on Wednesday
afternoons for a talk on the subject of Geography. I had on one occasion
a magnet and a compass, and was amusing the little ones with the magnet.
They seemed to have some idea of the meaning and use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
of the compass, and it occurred to me whether they knew what a mariner
was, so I asked them. No answer. After some time one precocious very
small boy ventured: &quot;<i>Please, sir, it&#39;s a young man what goes
after a young ooman</i>.&quot; [Query: &quot;<i>a-marrying
her.</i>&quot;]</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Touching the
Equator.</span>&mdash;&quot;What,&quot; demanded the inspector, &quot;is
the Equator?&quot; &quot;The Equator,&quot; said one ingenious hopeful,
&quot;is a <i>menagerie lion</i> running round the centre of the
earth.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">About the
Stretcher.</span>&mdash;A London infant school. The Raising of the
Widow&#39;s Son. Illustrations, Religious Tract Society Scripture Roll.

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
<span class="smcap">Ten Brief Ones.</span>&mdash;&quot;The Chartists
were men who compelled King John to sign Magna
Charta.&quot;&mdash;&quot;The Luddites were shells fired by the
Boers.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Sir Joseph Chamberlain invented fiscal policy,
and generally wears an orchard in his coat.&quot;&mdash;&quot;By the
Salic Law no woman can become King.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Wat Tyler was the

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>&quot;I NOW TAKE MY PEN IN HAND.&quot;</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">A policeman passes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">SMITH MINOR</span>, aged 9:

<hr />

<p class="indent">The curious workings of the child-mind are nowhere
more conspicuously illustrated than in the little essays and
&quot;pieces of composition&quot; which they are set to write. Of course
many of the children in the poorer elementary schools possess only a
very limited and very primitive vocabulary. Hence, when they adventure
upon rather long and unfamiliar words&mdash;conscientiously trying to
reproduce what they have just heard the teacher say in the general
verbal description of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
story to be committed by them to paper&mdash;they often achieve
fantastic results. But far more interesting is the fresh and original
view of a given situation which emerges. Far more interesting, too, are
the homely wit and the shrewd wisdom which these wholly delightful
little efforts display. Let these attest.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">It would be worth
it.</span>&quot;&mdash;&quot;What would you do with £5?&quot; having
been set to a class of girls, the following was one of the forthcoming
replies: &quot;Dear Teacher,&mdash;If I had five pounds of my very own
to do just what I like with, I should go on a railway journey and pull
the alarm signal and just see what really would happen. Of course the
five pounds would go to pay the fine; but I think it would be worth
it.&mdash;I remain your loving &mdash;&mdash;.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Man&#39;s
Cleverness.</span>&mdash;In a composition on Man a boy wrote, among
other things: &quot;Man is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
only animal that can strike a light, and also he is the only animal that

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Why they Punch the

Pole. Here is an extract from one paper: &quot;At last, we reached the
North Pole. <i>We sailed into the harbour and went to see the

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Concerning the
Pig.</span>&mdash;Standard V. Boy: &quot;A pig when living has four
legs, but when you kill it the butcher says it only has two, because he
calls the front legs shoulders and the back legs are called hams. Ham
tastes nice, and they boil it to eat at a wedding. The missus sprinkles
little bits of toast on it to make it look pretty.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Concerning Hares</span> (Standard
III. Composition).&mdash;&quot;Young hairs are called leveretts. Hairs
sleep much. They always sleep with their eyes open. Hairs have no
eyelashes. Their four legs are shorter than their hind legs. Their
ear-ring is remarkably good. Hairs pass their lives in soletude and
silents. They are often hunted on horseback and by hownds.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
<span class="smcap">On &quot;An Insect.&quot;</span>&mdash;&quot;An
insect&#39;s body is made up of ringed segments. When we tread on
beetles we hear them crack, that is the segments. Insects have not red
blood it is a sort of white liquid squas a fly and you will see what
colour blood it has. The fly likes to lay its eggs in meat where the
maggots will have food for she must die soon and will not be able to
feed her brood.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Camel</span> (by a
beginner).&mdash;&quot;Its nest is a very mean one, made of twigs,
leaves, &amp;c. It has a large body, and it is able to carry it full of
water. It has two humps of fat on its back, on which it is able to feed
when it is hungry. Its feet are webbed, in which it is able to cross the
desert. Its air is used to make brushes which are used for painting. It
also lays eggs. It eats worms.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Salvation Army</span>
(Standard IV.).&mdash;&quot;The Salvation Army is mostly on the street.
The women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
in it cover up all their hair with funny sorts of bonnets that stick out
in front to keep the rain off their faces. Sometimes they have names on
their hats like sailors. They make a deal of noise the worsed two is
called captain and leftennant. They tell people about Jesus and make
collections.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span
class="smcap">Gibraltar.</span>&mdash;&quot;Gibraltar is a strait on the
west coast of France. It is famous for a beautiful rock. It is about one
mile wide and five miles long. The English people took Gibraltar, and
they placed a great many big guns there. There are a great many people
at Gibraltar called apes. And the other people are very proud of them
because they are the only apes in Gibraltar. It is said they came from
America.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Alcohol and the
Blood.</span>&mdash;&quot;Of what is our blood composed, and what effect
has alcohol upon it?&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
This was the question. The following is the written answer: &quot;It is
made up of five million red insects and one thousand white ones to every
drop of blood. If alcohol is taken it causes these insects to dry up and
die and come to the front of the body. Sometimes it is from this cause
that people who drink alcohol are red in the face.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Ancient
Britons.</span>&mdash;It was the first year of compulsory composition,
and Standard III. were asked to reproduce a lesson on the Ancient
Britons in their own words. One young hopeful wrote: &quot;The acient
britons had no close on, they painted a wode on there body and it kept
them a bit warm, there chief men was called druids and my farther is
one, they call them acient britons becose it is a long time

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Perseverance.</span> [Essayist
aged 10.]&mdash;&quot;Were theirs a will theirs a way. This is a very old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
proverb that has to do with what I&#39;m writing. If we nearly always
succeed we always is getting on, but if we don&#39;t succeed, we should
try till we dose and then we should do it again which is a very wise way
to persever. People who sits down never gets on and People who gets on
dont sit down. We should all get on because it is the best thing to do
at all times. We will have trails (trials?) but we must try again until
them trails is gone.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Touching Bread.</span>&mdash;The
exercise was, &quot;Write an essay on Bread.&quot; The following was the
result: &quot;Bread is made with flour and barm and is very useful. It
is used for the people to eat and feeds them right. The bread gets
cheapper every year sometimes. The bread as raised this year. But the
people says it is getting the right weather. The bread is needed up by
men and women. It is best when the men make the bread. Some of the women
says that brown bread is good for their health.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
Bread is sometimes used for bread potises. Bread is a useful food
escpecially the crust. But crust is the best for to make peoples hair
curel. Bread is used for making sop for children. The bread is made with
flour, barm, and water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Japanese Lad&#39;s
Diary.</span>&mdash;This is an extract from a diary kept by a Japanese
boy who, when he wrote it, was a pupil of an English school in China.
The boy was sixteen years of age, and had been studying English for two
and a half years:&mdash;&quot;19th January.&mdash;I was up before the
school&#39;s clock struck six. On going to the washing chamber I found
that the day was not very severe. I went to my cover (cupboard) and
obtained the soap and sponge; the water was not so cold as previous
days, but as usual when I finished washing my fingers lost sense. I
dressed myself and rang the bell at 7 o&#39;clock punctually. At about
10 minutes past 7 Mr. A. wanted me. He wished me to descend the stairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
and command the boy (chief house servant) to attend to him and also to
see whether the fire was made in the studio. I obeyed implicity, but
just as I was descending the stairs I caught sight of the boy, so
immediately told him to go to Mr. A.; the fire was already made in
downstairs. I rang the second bell and went into the dormitory to see
all the boys. They were then all out of beds and dressing, there was
nobody late. The bell was rang at 8 o&#39;clock and we had finished our
repast at half past. The school bell was rang at quarter to nine and Mr.
B. took us in. The head master then came down. I learned copying,
mathematics, algebra, composition. Our ball was fix by the Tiffin time,
so we blew it up and had a fine game. The school began again at two.
Shorthand, book-keeping, grammar, were the subjects of that afternoon.
At four all the scholars came out. The football was then in the
playground, attended by several boys. I joined in with Mr. A. who sided
with me. A French-school lad appeared at the gate and was discussing
with Brown. I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
not know what were they disputing until Brown called me and told that he
came as a messenger from the above school to say that they like to
challenge us to play football. I thought it would be very pleasant to
have a game with them so I said we will be able to accept the challenge.
We thought it well to take Mr. A. and Mr. B., and told them about it.
The messenger went away to make enquiry about it. I went with him and
ask if they agree willingly, they told me they should have Mr. C. if we
take the above two. I came home and diffused among the fellows that I
have heard. Brown said that it would be much better to withhold Mr. A.
and B., but I gave no answer to it. The evening came. A friend called
upon me, and said that he was going to bestow upon me his photo. I
accompanied him, and was delighted at the receipt of his image. I came
home with it, and delighted to hear the dinner-bell. At half past seven
our dinner was over, and I rang the night school-bell. All came into the
studio (school) and did their

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">An Essay on an
Election.</span>&mdash;During a recent District Council election a great
deal of enthusiasm was shown in this place. Two days after a teacher
gave her class (Standard VII.) an essay to write on &quot;An
Election.&quot; The essay which follows is a complete and word-for-word
copy of the effort of one of the girls in the class: &quot;An election
means two things. First, the voice of the people spoken by choosing the
most eligible person or persons to represent their creed, requirements,
or grievances. Secondly, an election means lies, treachery, hypocrisy,
drunkenness, anxiety, disappointment, and glorification. God save us
from having another for twelve months.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Hat&#39;s
Autobiography.</span>&mdash;&quot;Fancy yourself an old hat,&quot; said
the teacher. &quot;Now write about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
yourself.&quot; Result: &quot;I am an old hat telling you all about me.
I am trimmed with velvet, and when any one take me out the people stand
in the doorway laughing at me, and I am not pleased with them. I dont
turn sulky like some boy&#39;s and girls do when any one call them. My
hat is trimmed with green velvet, satan, flowers, cherries, and a large
hostrige feather. When I go out the cherries in my hat tieses the birds.
I was bought in a large hat shop in leeds. I was bought in a shop down
briggate. It cost more than six shillings. I think I have told you all I
know, and so I will say no more at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At the
Menagerie.</span>&mdash;&quot;Describe,&quot; said the teacher, &quot;in
a letter to a friend, your visit yesterday to the menagerie.&quot; Here
is one of the letters: &quot;Dear Fred,&mdash;About a week ago I went to
a manajery in our town. The price to pay was tuppence and it was well
worth the money. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
were a great number of animals. The animals what made the biggest row
was the Kings of the beasts and a wild cat they had got. Their were a
cage full of monkeys which was doing funny tricks, some was catching
fleas and eating them. Their was a Elephant and a Kamel that give rides
for a penny. Stodgy Mathers tumbled of and made his nose bleed, he did
howl. There was various kinds of birds, such as the vulture, the Golden
eagle and kangaroo, besides macaws and other ferocious animals. There
was an horse. It had a main 13 feet long worth £10000. The man what
entered the Lions den was the tamer. He was dressed in tites. When he
went in he closed the door quick for fear they should spring out and
devour the people. He soon made the lions do whatever they like. Lions
are ferocious animals. The colour of the lion is yellow, also brown,
though some are also red. Tigers are no use only to eat up men and
called the maneater, likewise women and little babys, besides others. If
a man was to meet a tiger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
in a lonely forest he would never forget it. The elephant is remarkable
for its prodijous strenth. Its trunk is useful to drink up and eating.
Their was also a policeman at the door to keep disordered people and
children out of mischief. Policemen are useful things when on duty. The
colour of them is blue with a big helmet on. In a cage up a corner sat a
grilla eating, and which its teeth is very sharp, and its claws. I saw
some lepords and a zebra and a funny lobsided thing called a giraf. I
saved my penny and bought some nuts which I gave the monkeys. One big
faced fellow was so greedy he swallowed one of my nuts whole and it
nearly choked him. He rubbed his stummick and choked and grasped for
breath until the tears rolled down his cheeks. I thought I should die
laughing. Greediness never prospers. I also witnessed a fight between an
hyeena and a wolf. Wolfs is ferocious animals. It was amusing to watch
two monkeys fighting over a ginger bread. The biggest caught the other
by the tail and dropped him on the floor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
with a crash on his head. I left then and went home and had a good
tea.&mdash;your respectably, &mdash;&mdash;.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On Government.</span>&mdash;The
exercise was an essay &quot;On Government&quot;&mdash;after, of course,
a little disquisition by the teacher. The result:&mdash;&quot;Our
country has a King who can&#39;t do anything but what he ought to. There
were Georges I., II., III., and IV., but there was eight Henrys. There
is also houses called the Houses of Parliament. One of these is full of
lords, called the House of Lords, but the other is only built for them
gentlemen as perhaps you have seen some of them and it is called the
House of Common. No gentlemen can get in there unless they know as he
can make laws. But the King has to look them over and see as they are
made right. These Commons are called Conservatives and Liberals, and
they try and hinder one another as much as they can. They sometimes have
sides, and then you see it on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
the plackards, and you can hear men and your fathers a talking
quarrelling about it. Our country is governed a lot better than France,
and Germany comes about next. Then there&#39;s a lot of others, and then
comes Persia. Our country allways comes first, whoever you like to
ask.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Babies.</span>&mdash;&quot;Write
me a piece of composition on Babies,&quot; said the teacher. Here is a
boy&#39;s effort on, to him, an obviously uncongenial
topic:&mdash;&quot;Babys are little red things without bones nor teeth.
They have various sises, but just after they are borned, they are called
bypeds; their bones are grisle. They are 2 sects, male and female; and
are also very fat. When very young they do not have much hair; so you
cannot tell wether they will turn into boys or girls until their hair
grows. They are always asleep only when crying. They feed them on milk,
or chue a injyrubber tit, also their thum. When they are very little,
they ware pettycoats same as girls; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
boys soon wear jacket and trowsers. Girls are softer than boys, so they
have to keep on wearing pettycoats, frocks, and &amp;c., all their
lives. Some babys have to be borned, and the doctor brings some, when
the people have got plenty of money. Women and girls go silly over
babys, and kiss them all over, and say silly things. That&#39;s why
girls have dolls when they haven&#39;t any little brothers. Everybody as
to be a baby first. Once, before I can remember, I was a little baby.
Mother says, when I had my furst trowser suit on, she put me on the
table in frunt of the looking glass, and when I seen myself in the
mirrow, I screamed out, &#39;Take them off!&#39; &#39;Take them
off!&#39; &#39;It isnt me! It isnt me!&#39; and they had to take them
off. That&#39;s all I know about babys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Rival Views.</span>&mdash;One day,
recently, a teacher gave for composition to the boys and girls in the
upper standards an essay on &quot;Boys&quot; (for the girls) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
&quot;Girls&quot; (for the boys). The following extracts represent
fairly accurately the general tone of the opinions expressed by both
sides respectively:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Concerning &quot;Boys.&quot;</i>&mdash;&quot;Boys
are mischievous and jolly ... some are gentle.&quot;&mdash;&quot;They
dress differently from each other.... Many boys are very
lazy.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Most boys are very clever.... They are very
clumsy and clodhoppers.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Some of the boys play very
roughly and clumsily. They run about and step on each other&#39;s
feet.... They do not very often agree.&quot;&mdash;&quot;The boys talk
more than the girls.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Very few are
gentle.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Boys are male people.&quot;&mdash;&quot;They
are not much use to help their mothers in
house-work.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Their mothers put them nice and tidy, but
some of them go and get ragged again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Concerning &quot;Girls.&quot;</i>&mdash;&quot;Most
girls are very shy and angry.&quot;&mdash;&quot;They sew and darn the
boys&#39; stockings.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Their work is tidy and
clean.&quot;&mdash;&quot;They talk very silently.&quot;&mdash;&quot;They
have thin, weak voices.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Girls dress up about mid-day,
and go out, while the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
boys are hard at work.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Girls have a kind of false
pride about them. A girl will have feathers and flowers in her hat just
to show off.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Most of them are tall and delicate, and
they have long legs and little tiny voices.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Some girls
have their hair frizzed up and some wavered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Whale</span> (by a
ten-year-old).&mdash;&quot;The Whale is not called a fish, because it is
so big, so it is called a creature. They eat cockles and worms and
jellies, and people catches the whales with a fishing rod or a net, they
have to let the rope out so the whale dies for loss of breath. The
whales swim in shols [shoals] and they have a tarpoon at the end of
their tails, when he moves his tail, with one blow he will smash the
side of the ship. It has a very big head, and two fins or flappers, on
one side of its body. Whales got to come up out of the water on to the
land for to breath with their mouths, if he sees any people about he
will swallow them up for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
he has very big jar bones, and strong teeth called whaleboners.
Fishmongers catches whales an sail them. Some people eat whales with
salt and piper and bread, and some with potatoes. If you keep a whales
head under water he will die for want of breath. When they have finished
with the whale they send it adrift to get some more spern oil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Pat Answer.</span>&mdash;The
following story was read to a class of girls to be reproduced as a
composition exercise:&mdash;&quot;A gentleman was out driving in a
dog-cart with his coachman, who was an Irishman, when the horse took
fright and bolted. The coachman did his best, but it was evident that
the beast had got beyond his control. &#39;Pat,&#39; said the gentleman,
&#39;I&#39;d give five pounds to be out of this trap.&#39; &#39;Yer
honour needn&#39;t be so extravagant; ye&#39;ll be out of it for nothing
presently!&#39; He had scarcely finished speaking when the wheel was
caught by a heap of stones at the roadside, and both men were shot over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
the hedge into an adjoining field.&quot; &quot;Now, girls,&quot; said
the teacher, &quot;<i>three marks extra for the most suitable title for
this story</i>.&quot; Up went a forest of hands, and many and varied, if
somewhat commonplace, were the titles suggested. But a comical twist on
the face of a grey-eyed little Irish maiden in the front row took the
teacher&#39;s attention. &quot;Well, Norah, what title do you
suggest?&quot; &quot;<i>A cheap outing!</i>&quot; said Norah
demurely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On Smoking.</span>&mdash;The
following is an essay by a Standard V. boy. It was written after a
lecture by Dr. &mdash;&mdash; on the Evils of Smoking: &quot;Boys wish
to be manly in their ways and habbits, this is right but in some ways it
is wrong because in somethings which men does is not for boys to do.
Somethings which men does might not hurt them but it would hurt boys.
One thing is harmful to both men and boys or women that is bad language
it is a dreadful thing to hear women children and men using bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
language in all of the earth. But there is another bad habit of which
boys follow the example of men and this is a very harmful habit to boys
and to most men as well as boys. This habit is smoking with tobacco
which in the British Isle is carry on very much both with men and
children and sometimes women. Every time you go out if it is only just
outside the door you see men or boys smoking. Now when you are smoking
people say they have a stinging taste on their tongue if they only knew
what this taste is I am sure they would never smoke again for if you was
to tell them the number of gases which contained in tobacco they would
immediately take out their tobacco and pipe or cigarettes and throw them
away. For in the tobacco is a number of poisonous gases which when the
smoke is indulge into the mouth the different poisons run to certain
parts of the body, some gases go to lungs and others to liver and to the
heart and nerves and brain and sometimes it iffects the mind and
hearing. The names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
some of these gases are hydrogen, prussic acid gas and carbonic acid gas
and nicotine which is the most iffectable on the body and another of
them called sulpherette carbonic gas. Smokers are always liable to
indigestion which is brought on by these gases which is performed in
smoking, besides these gases is another which is known as monoxine. If
you ask a athlette if smoking was good for him he would tell plump no it
is not for it shortens the wind and makes the muscles feeble. Another
thing it deases your body and brings on heart desease. It is bad for a
man to smoke but it is worst to a growing lad for it injures the growth
and makes your limbs shakey. Boys who smoke when they are young never
occasionully live a long life, nor never grow to height because it
shivers (<i>i.e.</i> shrivels) up your liver and bye and bye you have
none at all and then you die and it brings on cancer which is another
dead desease.&quot;</p>

<span class="smcap">What Constitutes a Gentleman.</span> [Standard
VII.]&mdash;&quot;People sometimes think that when men are dressed in
nice clothes they are gentlemen but that is not the case, a gentleman is
a man who knows his manners. Down in the West End and City there are
great swells, but people think that because they have nice clothes they
are swells, but some are more like pigs. We might see a tramp walking
along a street who as hardly no boots nor clothes but very likely he has
his manners. A real gentleman ought to know his manners, and also not to
swear. A gentleman might be walking along a street and meet a young
lady, he would go up to her and raise his hat, and say, good evening
dear come along a me she would and when he left her he would say good
night darling, and ask her to meet him at so-an-so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">That Half-holiday.</span>&mdash;A
thirteen-year-old&#39;s description of a Thursday
half-holiday:&mdash;&quot;&#39;Pooh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
talk about hot weather, I&#39;m nearly suffocated. This the exclamation
of Fred Brown, one day after dinner. &#39;Why,&#39; said Tom, &#39;its
Thursday. I only just thought of it. Where shall we go?&#39; There was
silence for a few minutes, then Alf Jones said: &#39;Let us hire a boat
and row to Marlow, we can take tea.&#39; A hamper was duly packed and
carried down to the river. A boat was procured, it was in rather a bad
condition, but it was the best to be had. They tossed up as to who
should steer, and it fell to Tom, who knew as much about steering as a
hipopotamus. They divested themselves of their coats and settled down to
work. All went well utell they had gone about half a mile they went bang
into some rushes, much to the anoyance of the frogs. When they looked
round for damage they caught sight of Tom&#39;s hat float calmly down
the stream. Of course the owner had to rescue it. They extricated
themselves after a while, and resumed the journey without any very
terrible accident, of course catching crabs is nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
When they had been rowing for about a hour in the hot sun, they thought
Marlow a bit too far for them, so they landed on an island with some
nice trees on it, with the intention of having tea. They set to work to
get out the hamper from the boat. The spirit bottle, pulled out of a
heap of sandwiches, into which it had fallen, was found to be half full
of water, and the spirit gone and everything else was thoroughly soaked.
At Fred Brown&#39;s suggestion the sandwiches were put in the sun to
dry. When they were &#39;cooked&#39; they sat down to a tealess tea with
good appetites. Tom Smith took a sandwich and had a good mouthful of it,
but it did not stay in his mouth long he said it tasted like a lump of
methylated spirit, so nobody had any tea. They thought it was time to
get back. It was a fairly easy time going back, they were going with the
stream. They went home and had some supper, presently Fred Brown began
to groan, when they asked him what was the matter he said,
&#39;I&mdash;I only dr-drank some s-spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
and water, I th-thought it was le-lemonade, O&mdash;O.&#39; Next morning
everybody agreed that they had thoroughly enjoyed themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Lion.</span>&mdash;&quot;The
lion is the king of all animals. It is very fierce. Lion has very big
pause. It has a dark brown skin. It is got a peace of heir on its tale
and all round its next. The lion life on men and other things. When the
lion is young it is called a cube. The lion are mostly found in woulds
out in other parts of the world. There life are very unsafe because
hunter go out killed them. The lion is very useful. Its skin is used for
making firs and other thing. Its tees are very useful. The lion is used
for showes. It is used in Inder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Shipwreck.</span>&mdash;&quot;A
shipwreck is an awful thing for sometimes you get wet and sometimes you
get dround and sometimes you get burnt but the last is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
the worst. Once a big lyner got upset with a mortal wound in her side
but all the people was saved bar one and he got eat. Sharks and whales
feed on dead bodies and sometimes they eat them alive. We should never
eat fish what eat us because their canybals just like savages. Sailors
catch sharks with a leg of pork and a thick string which they cut up for
whalebone bone and blubber to make train oil.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Camel.</span>&mdash;&quot;He
is called the ship of the desart because he runs over the sand like a
ship and dont sink in. He runs different to the horse because he lifts
up two legs on one side of his body and then two on the other. He has
about a hundred stumics and each holds about a quart so when his master
kills him he can have a good drink. His hump is made of fat and he eats
this when he cant get grass or hay. Some camels are not camels because
he has two humps and his hair dont grow all over him and were it dont is
called calluses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
[callosities] because it kneels down and wears away. The Arab loves his
steed better than his wife and in our books theres a piece about him
called the Arab and his steed. His master was a prisoner and his
faithful camel took him round the waist and bore him swiftly to his
morning friends.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The
Crusades.</span>&mdash;&quot;The crusades were a body of men women and
children who followed the red cross. They were invented by Richard the I
and flocked in thousands round him to go to Egypt and some were stricken
with deadly disease but they marched on. Then they began to lessen in
number and fell gradually under the burning sands of Egypt and laden
heavy with heavy armour. At last Peter the Hermit cited Cairo but the
Catholicks bore down on him and he retreated. After travelling about for
many weary months he joined an opera company and was afterwards buried
in Westminster Abbey.&quot;</p>

interjection is a shout or something said by a person too surprised or
pained or frightened to make a sentence of his thoughts. It is not quite

Accordingly, ill-natured and cross people by their interjections come
very near to beasts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Concerning

Government, to control the boys, ruffians, and all individuals which
annoy or illuse the public. The boys politely term them
&#39;coppers,&#39; the burglars &#39;cops&#39; or &#39;narks.&#39; The
cooks are very fond of him, and call him &#39;dear Robert,&#39; and now
they are going &#39;on strike&#39; cooky will mourn, and the uneaten
rabbit-pie will go into the dustbin, and there will be quite a gloom
over the kitchens of Belgravia. There will be no kissing over the
railings, and if Bobby don&#39;t keep his eyes open Tommy Atkins will
collar the cake. Policemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
must be over or a certain size, and must have (I believe) big pedular
extremities, as all policemen&#39;s feet seem to be large. They have a
fête, not foot, once a year, and then cooky gets a day off. Then they
have kiss-in-the-ring, and other games, which introduce a mutual
contraction of the Orbicularis Oris.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">What I shall do in the
Holidays.</span>&mdash;&quot;What I expect to do in my holidays is the
greater part of the time to mind the baby. Two years and a-half old.
Just old enough to run into a puddle or to fall downstairs. Oh! what a
glorious occupation! my aunt or Sunday-school teacher would say, but it
is all very well for them, they ought to have a turn with him. I am
going to have a game at tying doors, tying bundles of mud in paper and
then drop it on the pavement. I shall buy a bundle of wood and tie a
piece of cord to it, and when someone goes to pick it up, lo! it has
vanished&mdash;not lost, but gone before. I shall go butterfly catching,
and catch some fish at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
Snob&#39;s Brighton (Lea Bridge). I shall finish up by having a
whacking, tearing my breeches, giving a boy two black eyes, and then
wake up on Monday morning refreshed and quite happy to make the
acquaintance of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&#39;s cane.&quot; The following,
written a little later, will convince every London teacher that R.H. had
practised fishing in the New River:&mdash;&quot;Man goes fishing, takes
his rod and enough tackle to make a telegraph wire and starts on his
piscatorial expedition. He arrives, and happy man is he if he has not
forgot something, a hook, his bait, or his float. He sits there,
apparently contented; he catches a frog or some other fine specimen of
natural history, and a cold, and a jolly good roasting from his bitter
half, when he arrives with some mackerel which he had bought at the
fishmonger&#39;s. He, poor man, did not know that they were sea-fish,
but his wife did. When juveniles go fishing they take a willow, their
ma&#39;s reel of best six-cord, a pickle jar, and a few worms, and
proceed to the New River happy. When they arrive they catch about fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
(a small thousand they call it), and are thinking of returning home,
when a gent with N. R. on his hat, and a good ash stick in his hand,
comes up. &#39;Ullo there,&#39; says he, &#39;what are you doing
there?&#39; &#39;Fishing, sir,&#39; answer they meekly. The man then
takes away their fish and rod, gives them some whales instead (on their
back). And they return home sadder but wiser boys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It would be a real novelty to write a book having even
the most remote reference to education without bringing this in. But
lest the headline should terrify the reader with the fearful
apprehension that it is my purpose to plunge once again into the bitter
and apparently never-ebbing waters of religious strife, let me hasten to
say that I have no such maleficent intention. In the classification of
my budget of anecdotes I find I have an abundant selection of those
which have arisen in connection with the daily Scripture lesson; and, as
I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
already said, they represent the richest harvest of all. The reasons for
this I have endeavoured to set forth. It only remains for me, in
submitting the following stories, to add that no irreverence is
intended. There are, I know, some curiously constituted people who find
offence in the most ingenuous laugh if provoked by what they deem a
sacred subject. I would respectfully yet firmly adjure them not to read

<div class="poem">

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Thou sha&#39;t not Bow
Dean!</span>&quot;&mdash;Still affecting the Commandments, though a
story of another colour, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">In a village in Yorkshire dwelt the two granddaughters
of a former vicar. These good ladies often met in the streets the
children who attended the village school. On such occasions they
expected the latter to acknowledge them&mdash;the boys by raising their
hats and the girls by curtseying. Now one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span> sturdy urchin often disregarded the
ladies, and they accordingly spoke to his father respecting his conduct.
The parent questioned the boy, and soon found out that the complaint
laid against him was true. On being asked why he did not lift his cap,
the culprit replied, &quot;Ah dean&#39;t think ah ou&#39;t ta dea sa.
<i>Dean&#39;t us larn at t&#39; skeal, &#39;Thou sha&#39;t not bow dean
ta ony graven image&#39;?</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In Braid
Yorkshire.</span>&mdash;The diocesan inspector was questioning a class
of boys about the story of Joseph as a slave, interpreter, &amp;c., and
incidentally asked the following question: &quot;What did Joseph&#39;s
father think when the brothers brought Joseph&#39;s coat covered with
blood?&quot; The reply of a small boy quite upset the official&#39;s
gravity: &quot;Please, sir, <i>he thought a coo had tupped
him</i>!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On Bread and
Chicken.</span>&mdash;Imagine the surprise of the schoolmistress when a
little lad, in giving his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
version of the &quot;Temptation,&quot; informed her that Christ partook
of <i>bread and chicken</i> in the wilderness. Judicious questioning
elicited the fact that the young hopeful had based his opinion upon two
extracts: &quot;<i>Man shall not live by bread alone</i>,&quot; and
&quot;<i>Get the hens, Satan</i>!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Three Evils.</span>&mdash;It was
the annual Scripture examination, and the inspector was questioning a
class upon the Catechism. &quot;It was promised for you in your
baptism,&quot; said the official inquisitor, &quot;that you would fight
against three great evils. Tell me what they are.&quot; &quot;<i>My
godfathers and godmothers</i>,&quot; was the reply of one youth.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In the Application
thereof.</span>&mdash;The school had been closely questioned by the
inspector in Scripture, and at last a bright idea seemed to strike him,
for he said: &quot;Suppose Christ came into this room now and offered to
perform a miracle for you, what would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
you ask him to do?&quot; There was silence for some moments, and then up
went a hand. The inspector asked for a reply, which was: &quot;<i>Cast
out a devil, sir!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Baste but not a
Bull.</span>&mdash;The following occurred in a Dublin school during the
Scripture lesson:&mdash;&quot;What does the Bible say will happen to the
proud?&quot; asked the examiner. &quot;<i>Please, sir, they will become
animals</i>,&quot; replied one bright little chap. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s
a curious answer. What text have you to prove it?&quot; queried the
interrogator. &quot;He that humbleth himself shall be exalted, and he
that exalteth himself <i>shall be a baste</i>!&quot; promptly replied
one of the youngest of Ould Oireland&#39;s hopefuls.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Flesh Pots.</span>&mdash;A
class was in the habit of singing at close of school the well-known
Grace: &quot;These creatures bless,&quot; &amp;c. Having some doubts as
to the accuracy of the words being sung by one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
boy, the master asked him to repeat them. He was not a little astonished
to hear recited the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

Jerusalem to Jericho, <i>and as he was going the thorns sprang up and

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Some Unfamiliar
Exhortations.</span>&mdash;Children, as I have said, often get hold of
the wrong words in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
prayers and hymns. For instance, one child was heard to pray:
&quot;Forgive me all that I have done <i>on Christmas Day</i>&quot;
(amiss this day). Another was heard to plead: &quot;<i>And give us an
eagle</i>&quot; (and deliver us from evil). While a third after meals
repeated: &quot;<i>Let manners to us all be given</i>&quot; (Let manna
to our souls be given).</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Noah&#39;s First
Task.</span>&mdash;At a recent Scripture examination the examiner asked
the following question in the infants&#39; class: &quot;What was the
first thing Noah did when he came out of the Ark?&quot; A tiny girl put
up her hand, and on being asked, said: &quot;<i>Please, sir, he buried
all the drownded people.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Why a

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">An Altogether Unexpected
Reply.</span>&mdash;A teacher who had given a lesson on the Birth of

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Who was Sorry?</span>&mdash;A

Little Boy (after deep thought): &quot;<i>The fatted calf,
sir.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">About Eli.</span>&mdash;Teacher:
&quot;Tell all you know of Eli.&quot; Small Girl: &quot;Eli was a very

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">I

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">And to bed you

little ones once to their teacher on Friday afternoon. She, consenting,
asked whether they wanted a new one or an old one.
&quot;Cinderella,&quot; said one; &quot;Aladdin,&quot; asked another.
Then from a rather heavy boy, &quot;<i>I want the tale of Citrate of
Magnesia and to bed you go.</i>&quot; She paused in complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
obfuscation. Then a sharp little girl said: &quot;That&#39;s wrong,
governess, it wasn&#39;t Citrate of Magnesia, but it <i>was</i> to bed
you go, <i>and they were all in the fire and not burnt</i>.&quot; The
teacher recognised the Bible incident of <i>Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego</i>!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">What Happened.</span>&mdash;Scene:
Class of infants and Standard I. Time: Scripture lesson. Teacher,
impressively (to children anxiously watching&mdash;in
imagination&mdash;the development of an old-world tragedy): &quot;Then
Abraham having bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, took the
knife in his hand&mdash;when lo!&mdash;What happened?&quot; Big dunce
from the gallery (in a voice hoarse with excitement and pent-up
feeling): &quot;<i>Hisaac &#39;ollered out.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Biblical Cricket.</span>&mdash;The
vicar recently came down to distribute the prizes to the successful
athletes at the school sports. In his prefatory remarks, he mentioned
that games were not unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
even in scriptural times, and asked if any boy could furnish a text to
prove this. &quot;Yissir,&quot; said one urchin, &quot;our Lord said to
a team of His disciples when they was agoing to play in a cricket match:
&#39;Beware of the <i>&#39;leven</i> of the Pharisees.&#39;&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The One Thing
Necessary.</span>&mdash;Venerable Archdeacon: &quot;Now, my dear
children, I will ask you a few questions in your Catechism. Which of you
can tell me the two things necessary in Baptism?&quot; &quot;Quite
right, &#39;Water.&#39; Water is one thing, and what is the other? What!
can none of you think what else is necessary? Well, little girl, what do
you say?&quot; Little Girl: &quot;<i>Please, sir, a baby.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Division of
Labour.</span>&mdash;The subject of a Scripture lesson to a class of
girls in Standards V. and VI. happened one day to be the Resurrection.
Whether the curate, fresh from the &#39;Varsity, failed to make the
matter interesting because of faulty arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
of matter or indifferent method is not recorded. But the girls did not
show much attention while the changes which are to come to our vile
bodies were being tabulated. So, turning to one girl more conspicuously
inattentive than the rest, the curate sharply asked: &quot;Mary Jane!
who made your vile body?&quot; &quot;<i>Please, sir, mother made the
body and I made the skirt</i>,&quot; replied Mary Jane.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Taking the Bones.</span>&mdash;A
curate had been talking diligently for half an hour to a class of school
children, but their attention was not very freely given. The subject was
&quot;The Doings of the Children of Israel,&quot; and very special
mention had been made of how they had been commanded to take the bones
of Joseph with them when they made their exodus from the land of Egypt.
Suddenly pouncing upon one boy who was particularly inattentive, the
curate said: &quot;Whose bones did the children of Israel take with them
out of Egypt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
Sam?&quot; Sam was nonplussed for a moment, then a brilliant idea struck
him, and his answer came out triumphantly: &quot;<i>Their
own!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Moses and the Burning
Bush.</span>&mdash;The teacher was one morning giving a lessen on
&quot;Moses and his talk with God,&quot; introducing, of course, the
mystery of the burning bush not being consumed, and laying particular
stress on the reverent attitude of Moses in taking off his shoes before
approaching the sacred place. At the close of the lesson the teacher
questioned his pupils to gauge their interest, and among other queries
he submitted the following: &quot;Why did Moses take off his shoes
before approaching the bush?&quot; Judge of his consternation when he
received the following reply from a little fellow of eight years:
&quot;<i>Please, sir, to warm ees feet!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Clever Teacher.</span>&mdash;The
vicar of a Somerset parish was noted for his extremely precise
enunciation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
He was in the habit of taking the Scripture lessons in the village
school, and had spent some time on &quot;The Lives of the
Patriarchs.&quot; One morning he questioned a class upon the story of
Jacob. &quot;What did Isaac tell Jacob to do when he left home after
obtaining the blessing?&quot; asked the vicar, pointing to a dull, big
boy. &quot;He told un to pay the man, zur,&quot; was the response.
&quot;To pay the man!&quot; replied the vicar wonderingly; &quot;what
man?&quot; &quot;Please, zur, I doant &#39;zacly remember what his other
name were, <i>but &#39;twere Dan somebody or other</i>.&quot; The vicar
lost the point of the answer; but the teacher, with keen appreciation,
quoted softly to herself, &quot;<i>Arise, go to Pa-dan-aram</i>,&quot;
and she thought the boy was not wholly to blame for thinking that <i>Dan
Aram</i> was a man, and ought to be paid.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Rough on the
Deacon.</span>&mdash;&quot;Explain,&quot; said the teacher, &quot;all
you can about the words Bishop, Priest, and Deacon.&quot; &quot;I never
saw a Bishop,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
wrote one hopeful. &quot;A Priest is a man in the Old Testament, <i>and
a Deacon is a thing you pile up on the top of a hill and set fire to
it</i>!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Thirteenth
Apostle.</span>&mdash;The question was: &quot;How many Apostles were
there?&quot; &quot;Thirteen,&quot; said one little chap.
&quot;Thirteen!&quot; repeated the teacher in astonishment. &quot;I
thought there were only twelve!&quot; &quot;St. Matthew,&quot; replied
the boy, &quot;tells us the names of twelve, and St. John gives us the
name of the other one&mdash;<i>Verily, that Jesus used to talk to so
much</i>.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE FOND PARENT.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Political Economy is the science that teaches
us to get the greatest benefit out of the least possible amount of
honest labour.</i>&quot;&mdash;<span class="smcap">WEARY WILLY,
JUNIOR.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent">There is no more universal fallacy than the
firmly-rooted prejudice that finds a comment in the old tag that
&quot;Everybody&#39;s goose is a swan.&quot; How impregnably established
is this conviction in the parental mind&mdash;when in contemplation of
the capacity of its wonderful offspring&mdash;only teachers know.
Eternal are the complaints that whilst Jimmy Miggs has been promoted to
the Third Standard &quot;Our Willie&quot; remains in the Second! And
brilliant is the diplomacy that is needed to make the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
situation parentally endurable. Then there is the irate parent, the
sacred person of whose immaculate hopeful has been gently touched with
the discriminating hand of discreet personal chastisement. Ah me! What
havoc such an one can work with the calm serenity of the schoolroom.
Strangely enough, it is amongst the thriftless and self-indulgent
minority of working classes&mdash;those who shockingly neglect and
ill-treat their children themselves&mdash;that the teacher finds the
greatest trouble in this matter of objection even to the most moderate
and wisely-administered corporal punishment.</p>

<p class="indent">For myself, I hit upon an excellent expedient when the
peace of the school was suddenly ravished by the sudden and unbidden
entrance of some angry &quot;mother.&quot; With great suavity I offered
her a chair and considerately pressed her into it. If she could be
induced to rehearse her complaints whilst still sitting down the fires
of her fury would soon flicker out. Indeed, I have never yet met an
angry woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
in any walk of life who could sufficiently express her feelings whilst
sitting down. <i>Verb. sap.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The parental &quot;Note&quot; is often very amusing,
sometimes abusive, and occasionally clever and caustic. Excuses for
absence, which involve a reference to ailments with rather unspellable
names are, naturally enough, badly boggled. Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
Influenza, Lumbago, Inflammation, Diarrh&oelig;a&mdash;what tribulation
these half-dozen words represent to be sure! And what excruciating
distortions the parental note bears upon its usually rough and crumpled
face. I remember <i>neuralgia</i> once being rendered &quot;<i>real raw
jaw</i>,&quot; which is not so far out after all! &quot;Very bad with
<i>New Roger</i>&quot; is not so near a shot. I also recall a note of
excuse that informed the teacher that Charlie couldn&#39;t come to
school &quot;<i>because he has got haricot veins</i>!&quot; This is as
curious as &quot;<i>In bed with Piper&#39;s Dance</i>!&quot; I have seen
a &quot;note,&quot; too, which speaks of Mary being &quot;<i>down with
an illustrated throat, with glaciers on both sides</i>!&quot; And,
finally, there was once the alarming case of Alfred, who had &quot;gone
to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
hospital to have some <i>aneroids</i> taken from his nose.&quot; But let
a few of these little missives speak for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Novel Mode of
Travelling.</span>&mdash;The following excuse for lateness from a Dover
parent is very appropriate to a seaside town: &quot;Dear miss, please
excuse mary being late as she <i>as been out on a herring</i>.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Money Market

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">One for the

Emena.</span>&quot;&mdash;Please sir hary and emena are unfit to

excuse was to convey the information that Harry and Emma had gone to the

had seen the attendance officer (Mr. Bennett) about it.</p>

shall go to another school for he does reading and writing very well at

<h3>LITTLE SCIENTISTS AT SEA.</h3>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>If the earth did not revolt it would be
either all equal days or all equal nights</i>,&quot; is the deliberate
judgment of one young geographer; and the state of mental obfuscation
here discovered finds a counterpart in many geographical answers given
in the earlier days. <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i> have been described as
<i>the two most famous volcanoes in the world</i>; and the Nile has been
mentioned as <i>rising in Mungo Park</i>. <i>Penzance</i> has been
spoken of as &quot;<i>the place where the pirates come from</i>&quot;;
and the Red Indians have been located as coming from <i>Red India</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
Here is a brief list of what I may call geographical
&quot;howlers.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In the Geography
Lesson.</span>&mdash;&quot;The sun never sets on English possessions,
because the sun sets in the West, and all the English possessions are in
the North, South, and East.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Arctic regions are neither hot nor cold.
They abound in birds of beautiful plumage and of no song, such as the
elephant and the camel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A table-land gets its name from its steep sides
and flat top. It&#39;s all right when once you are up on the top, but
it&#39;s no joke getting up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The tides are a fight between the earth and the
moon. All water tends towards the moon, because there is no water in the
moon, and Nature abhors a vacuum. Gravitation at the earth keeps the

the inspector, who was elderly and deaf. The teacher trembled with
apprehension as she heard a boy answer: &quot;<i>The Land of Goshen,

approvingly: &quot;Quite right! Quite right! <i>The Atlantic

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Some History Lesson
Blunders.</span>&mdash;Now let me turn briefly to the History lesson and
note the curious blunders and anachronisms that a modern rendering or a
juvenile misapprehension of old-world facts reveal. Let me set out a few
instances:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The cause of the Peasants&#39; Revolt was that a
shilling poultice was put on everybody over sixteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The poll-tax was to be paid by everyone who had
a head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Fire of London, although looked on at first
as a calamity, really did a great deal of good. It purified the city
from the dregs of the plague and burnt down eighty-nine
churches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;King James I. was very unclean in his habits: he
never washed his hands and married Anne of Denmark.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Henry VIII. was a very good king. He liked
plenty of money. He had plenty of wives, and died of ulcers in the
legs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Edward III. would have been king of France if
his mother had been a man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The conquest of Ireland was begun in 1170 and is
still going on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Pilgrim Fathers were the parents of the
young men who took journeys to the Holy Land in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
the Crusades. They had to give an allowance to their godly sons while
they were away in the East. But they never grudged it, because it was an
honour to be a Pilgrim&#39;s father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir Philip Sydney gave the last drop of water in
his jug to a dying soldier on the field of Waterloo, as was mentioned in
the Duke of Wellington&#39;s despatches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Milton is the celebrated author of the
excursion, and lived chiefly in the lake country near Carlyle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Teacher</i>: &quot;In whose reign was that palace
built?&quot; <i>Scholar</i>: &quot;Edward the
Confectioner&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;George I. was the son of the Electric
Sophia.&quot;</p>

<span class="smcap">In the Science Class.</span>&mdash;Not less amusing
are the mistakes which arise during the &quot;elementary science&quot;
lesson. Here are a few cases in point:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A vacuum is nothing shut up in a box. They have
a way of pumping out the air. When all the air and everything else is
shut out, naturally they are able to shut in nothing, where the air was
before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A drug is any wholesome vegetable food for
taking once in a way but not for regular food.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">With the Little
Babbages.</span>&mdash;&quot;Things which are double each other are
greater than anything else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Circumference is a straight line round the
middle of a plane.&quot;</p>

they are crooked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
<i>Question</i>: &quot;If the sum of two numbers is a multiple of ten,
what relation is there between the figures in the units place in the
squares of the two numbers?&quot; <i>Answer</i>: &quot;(1) The same
relation. (2) Ought is the relation existing between them.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Domestic
Economy.</span>&mdash;<i>Question</i>: &quot;Give directions for
sweeping a room.&quot; <i>Answer</i>: &quot;Cover up the furniture with
dust sheets, scatter damp tea leaves over the carpet, then carefully
sweep the room into the dust pan and throw it out of the
window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The following notes are selected from the answers
given at a recent examination of girls between twelve and sixteen years
of age:&mdash;&quot;Cheese is as wholesome as 8½ pounds of
beef.&mdash;Beef is a useful article of food obtained from different
animals, such as the cow, sheep, pig, &amp;c.&mdash;The lean of beef
belongs to the animal kingdom, and the fat to the vegetable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
kingdom.&mdash;Butter is good for the brain.&mdash;Milk is called a
model food because it models the form of the child.&mdash;Without eating
potatoes we would become very delicate, because potatoes are very
necessary to sustain human life.&mdash;<i>Pot-au-feu</i> is mashed-up
meat.&mdash;<i>Crétins</i> are generally served up with green pea
soup.&mdash;If a man lives without food for a considerable time, say
sixty days, he will die at the end of a month; or if the constitution is
delicate, he may only live for a week, or less.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>A MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTION.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<i>The Triple Alliance is Faith, Hope, and
Charity!</i>&quot;&mdash;EMMA JANE.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Best Side.</span>&mdash;A
penny was the object in question. The children had examined its
superscription&mdash;obverse and reverse, when little Polly shyly said,
&quot;I like this side best, teacher&quot;&mdash;pointing to Neptune and
the shield. &quot;Why, Polly,&quot; demanded the teacher. &quot;<i>Cause
you can see the Queen riding on a bicycle!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jonah&#39;s
Prayer.</span>&mdash;It was an infants&#39; class of forty children or
thereby. The young teacher had found the way to the hearts of her
pupils, and the children quite forgot they were engaged in work. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
Everything she said and did was real and right in their eyes, and her
Bible stories were a source of wondrous delight. They would not have
been astonished had they met Abraham or even some of the antediluvians
in the street. The head master, on visiting the room, found them all
interested in the career of Jonah, and told them he would come again to
learn what they could tell about the errant prophet. As he expected, he
found the story familiar to them, and so, with the view partly of trying
their power of expression and partly of witnessing the perplexity of the
embryo scholars, he asked them to tell him Jonah&#39;s prayer while he
was in the whale. Words to express their pent-up knowledge failed most
of them, but one more vigorous than the rest relieved himself thus:
&quot;<i>Jonah just said, &#39;God, lat me oot o&#39;
this.&#39;</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">When They&#39;re Running

is a noun?&quot; that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span> has drawn out the hoary answer,
&quot;Name of an animal, person, place, or thing.&quot; Of course the
inspector follows up with the almost equally antique &quot;Am <i>I</i> a
noun?&quot; and the little fellow tumbles into the creaking old trap
with a cheery &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Are you a noun?&quot; proceeds
the inspector, and the &quot;Yes, sir&quot; of the reply shows very
little loss of confidence. &quot;Are all the boys in the class
nouns?&quot; The sturdy little grammarian feels from the tone that
someone has blundered, and the &quot;Yes, sir&quot; this time has an
uncertain sound. Everything up to this point has been done in the most
approved fencing style&mdash;three cuts up and one down; all the moves
are as hackneyed as in the King&#39;s Knight&#39;s Pawn opening. It is
only when the inspector is about to effect Fool&#39;s
Mate&mdash;&mdash;But let me give it as it happens. <i>Inspector</i>:
&quot;What is a noun?&quot; <i>Boy</i>: &quot;Name of an animal, person,
place, or thing.&quot;&mdash;<i>I.</i>: &quot;Am <i>I</i> a noun?&quot;
<i>B.</i>: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&mdash;<i>I.</i>: &quot;Are you a
noun?&quot; <i>B.</i>: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&mdash;<i>I.</i>: &quot;Are
all the boys in the class nouns?&quot; <i>B.</i> (a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
doubtfully): &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&mdash;<i>I.</i>: &quot;And are all
the boys running about in the playground nouns?&quot; <i>B.</i>
(brightening up): &quot;Please, sir, no, sir. <i>When they&#39;re
running about they&#39;re verbs!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Where the Ostrich Lays Its
Eggs.</span>&mdash;A class was being questioned by H.M. inspector on the
ostrich. He asked the size of the ostrich egg, but could only get
&quot;Very big&quot; or &quot;Very large&quot; for answers, so he asked
them to mention something that would show him <i>how</i> big they were.
After some hesitation, one boy put his hand up, and when asked, replied:
&quot;Please, sir, as big as your head.&quot; The inspector laughed, and
then asked: Where does the ostrich deposit its eggs?&quot; Again the
same boy put up his hand and looked very anxious to be asked. When the
inspector said, &quot;Well, my little man, where?&quot; the boy replied,
&quot;<i>Please, sir, in our school museum!</i>&quot;</p>

the chastisement, burst out laughing. The master, in a tone of anger

occurs the line: &quot;<i>So on it went capering and playing its
pranks.</i>&quot; The inspector stopped the class here, and asked the
class to tell him the meaning of capering, and also the name of any
animal that cuts capers. The answers given by several boys were a

repeated the offence. Turning to his desk, the teacher made a determined
effort to discover the error in the totals, when his tormentor again

asked, &quot;Who would like to ask the other children a question?&quot;

into any trouble or mischief. &quot;<i>Same to you, sir!</i>&quot;
shouted the whole school with one accord. Whether this was quiet humour
or a mechanical reply to the time-honoured &quot;Merry Christmas,
boys!&quot; which they had taken my final words to imply I cannot say.
But I am trying to live up to the injunction as this little book

standards on &quot;Regeneration.&quot; He commenced by asking the class
if any of them could tell him the meaning of the word
&quot;Regeneration,&quot; but no reply was forthcoming. It therefore
fell to the curate to define the word. He said, &quot;Regeneration means
to be born again.&quot; Addressing himself to one little fellow, the
curate said, &quot;Now, my little boy, wouldn&#39;t you like to be born
again?&quot; &quot;No, I shouldn&#39;t,&quot; answered he. &quot;For
why?&quot; asked the curate. The boy quickly responded, &quot;<i>Because

song or recitation, music or dance, for the pleasure of the rest.
&quot;Oh dear! Jack!&quot; said his mother &quot;How

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>

composed. The genius of the little group had been instructed to write

sentence: &quot;<i>The horse sometimes has a long tail or

&quot;that is hardly a good text,&quot; and, pointing to another lad,
asked <i>him</i> to give a text, and the lad said, &quot;<i>Go thou and
do likewise!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Indignation.</span>&mdash;The

their stories historical or scriptural. When asked for the reply of
Naaman the leper to the command to wash seven times in Jordan, a boy

the 9th chapter of Isaiah, and verse 6, which reads: &quot;For unto us a
Child is born, unto us a Son is given, <i>and the government shall be

meant by the government being upon His shoulder. One child, holding up

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Widow Again.</span>&mdash;The

repeat that Article. Boy: &quot;No freeman, merchant, or villain, shall
be excessively fined for a small offence; the first shall not be
deprived of his means of livelihood; the second of his merchandise; and
the third of his <i>implements of husbandry</i>.&quot; Teacher:

<span class="smcap">Found Out.</span>&mdash;A school attendance officer
quite recently met a lad who, instead of being at school, was wending
his way to a public-house for a pint of beer. &quot;How is it you are
not at school, my boy?&quot; said the man of law. &quot;It&#39;s washing
day, and I&#39;m going for a pint of ale for my mother.&quot; He let the
boy go on his errand and walked straight to the lad&#39;s house.
&quot;Good morning, Mrs. So-and-so. How is it your boy is not at school
this morning?&quot; &quot;Ah! bless you,&quot; she says, &quot;the poor
lad&#39;s ill in bed, and has been the past two days. I&#39;m afraid we
shall never rear him, for you see he&#39;s been delicate ever sin he was
born.&quot; &quot;Can I see him?&quot; returned the officer.
&quot;Certainly, if you&#39;ll wait a minute till I see if he&#39;s
awake. He&#39;s had a bad night, and I should not like to disturb him if
he&#39;s asleep.&quot; The good lady went on tiptoe to the foot of the
stairs and called out very softly, &quot;Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, are you
awake?&quot; Returning to the attendance officer she said, &quot;You
see, Mr. Schoolboard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
Johnny&#39;s asleep, and it would be such a pity to disturb him.&quot;
Just as she finished, in walks Johnny with the pint of beer. The old
lady, to make the best of a bad job, threw up her hands and exclaimed,
&quot;<i>My dear Johnny, how did you get out? What a bad lad to get out
of the bedroom window again, after all I&#39;ve said!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Trifle

she shouted out, &quot;Now, master, here&#39;s a lad that&#39;s been
playing the wag [truant], and I don&#39;t intend to leave this blessed
spot until I see him skinned. Please, master, skin him alive! <i>I must
see him skinned!</i>&quot; she said. To make the best of a serious case,
the master replied, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t skin till ten o&#39;clock,
and it is only a quarter past nine yet, so you had better sit down till
I&#39;m ready.&quot; She took a seat, still holding the lad by the
collar, and he went to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
desk. In about five minutes she sent the boy to his class, and coming up
to the master, whispered very softly into his ear: &quot;<i>Please,
master, don&#39;t touch the poor lad, he&#39;s so delicate, you could
almost blow him away with a breath!</i>&quot;</p>

woman then turned suddenly round and, seizing the lad by the jacket,
gave him a good shaking, saying at the same time, &quot;<i>I&#39;ll

Johnny had been on an errand for his mother and was consequently late

made the mother somewhat dubious about Johnny&#39;s going to school, and
this is how the note read: &quot;Dear Sir,&mdash;Please excuse Johnny
for being late, <i>and kindly let me know if he hasn&#39;t

The answer came back that he was playing truant&mdash;sent by the
mother. The next day the master made inquiries, and found that the
mother had sent this message because she did not wish the boy&#39;s
father, who was at home when the messenger arrived, to know that
<i>she</i> had kept him at home. During this time the boy himself was
hidden in a cupboard. A few weeks after a similar occurrence happened,
and a like answer was sent to the master by the mother. The next day the
boy appeared with the following note: &quot;Sir,&mdash;Sorry my boy was
away yesterday, but he had to go to the hospital and was kept, and I
never sent him yesterday, and <i>I was sorry to tell a lye like last
time. Please forgive me again.</i>&mdash;Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;.&quot;</p>

was poor was asked for his reason, and he replied as follows:

he had been a rich man <i>he would have had a bed to

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On Girls.</span>&mdash;By a
boy.&mdash;&quot;There are two sorts of children, boys and girls and of
the two boys are the best. Girls cause all the rows and quarrels. They
think they are wonderful if they can get a bird&#39;s feather stuck in
their hat. They are proud and vain and are always gossipping and making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
mischief. I simply hate them. They boast of what they can do, this that
and the other and a fat lot it is when it comes to the put. If there
were no girls and women in the world, it would be a very peaceful place.
They love to sit and rest. Girls do vary from day to day. On washing
days they think they are nearly killed. They would rather gossip half a
day, than walk half a mile. Its no good, they are a bad race and
deceitful. If your wife sells anything she keeps a shilling back. Girls
like to wear rings and think they are ladies. They bob their hair on the
top like mountains and wears a fringe to make us boys think they are
pretty, but aint they just deceived. The young men have a hard job to
find a good and hard working wife in these days. Girls are cowards and I
never knew one to face danger. If a cow looks at them they run and cry.
Boys go about with their eyes open and their mouths shut, just the
opposite to girls. Boys are also strong and useful while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
girls are timid, frightened weak little creatures. I would not be a girl

after you have stopet. If you are in a dark room and somebody brings a
light it is in your eye a tenth of a cetend. The cinmattergraf is like a
fonagrapt. It is like a mager lantin. A cinmattergraf is eaquil to five
thousand candles. The ribbing rowls off one rowler on to another rowler.
The cinmattergraf was worked by angle. It is like a soingnmersheen. It
will play any song. The cinmattergraf talks like people. You cant
understand what a gramophone says. When you light the oxgin it not give
much light. When one of the things is burken the other blows in and it
give bleu light. When the man shows the foters he has to put the lamp
out. Because if he does not put the lamp out the pictures look shady. It
is the light which helps to show the pictures. The pictures on the
cinmattergraf are only an inch big. One picture that it showed was a
woman laughting, and you could see every form her mouth was in. When

and worker horses and little welsh ponies. A mule is a horse with long
ears and if a horse had long ears it would be called a donkey. You can

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On the Baby.</span>&mdash;&quot;A
baby is a man or woman as they first enter the world, and is sometimes
called a infant, and they bring plenty of joy to its parents. Babies
need much care because the bones are not strong enough for the baby to
be used naturally. When a baby is a few months old a malecart is wanted
so as to give it some fresh air, and it as to be nursed till it can
crawle about on the flour. Most women like babies very much and
wouldn&#39;t do without them. When first it is born it is very teisey
and begins to cry, and they are enough to make anyone mad. It also needs
a lot of care, for it will enhail any disease. Baby is the pet of the
family, especially mother, who if the baby is a boy he becomes her
darling boy in after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
years. When baby is about four years old it is briched if it is a boy,
but if a girl she remains in her same clothes. To look after a baby is
very awkard if you ain&#39;t used to it, for they jump and kick and have
to be carefully handled. It is crisined when it is old enough to eat
solid food. Some babies are very tiresome and have to be nutritiously
looked after. My father told me that he came in a little blue box, but
learned men say we came from monkeys. If the mother trys to learn it to
walk very early it will make them bandy. My baby is a dear little
thing!&quot;</p>

<h2>Transcriber Notes:</h2>

<p class="indent">Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of
the speakers. Those words were retained as-is.</p>

<p class="indent">The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up
paragraphs and so that they are next to the text they illustrate. Thus
the page number of the illustration might not match the page number in
the List of Illustrations, and the order of illustrations may not be the
same in the List of Illustrations and in the book.</p>

<p class="indent">Errors in punctuations and inconsistent hyphenation were not corrected
unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p class="indent">On page 9, a period was added after &quot;CHAPTER I&quot;.</p>

<p class="indent">On page 71, a single quotation mark after &quot;<i>Cast out a devil, sir!</i>&quot; was replaced with a double quotation mark.</p>

<p class="indent">On page 98, a period was added after &quot;hot nor cold&quot;.</p>

<p class="indent">On page 132, a single quotation mark before &quot;How many&quot; was replaced with a double quotation mark.</p>
